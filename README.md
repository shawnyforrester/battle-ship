# battle-ship
Welcome to Battleship Game, a classic two-player strategy game where you go head-to-head in a battle on the high seas! In this game, each player gets to place their ships on a 10x10 grid and take turns trying to sink their opponent's fleet. Place your ships strategically, use your wits to outmaneuver and outgun your opponent(the program itself). Will you be the last one standing, or will you sink to the depths by my program?
